## About Me

This is a website I built to showcase a little bit about myself. Using JS you are able to take a short 5 question quiz about me. After you take the quiz, you may enter the webpage and read a little about myself and follow the links included to my github and Linkedin.

### Reflections and Comments

- Overall I had a good experience building this site, but I did have some issues where another set of eyes could have helped. Having your peers review your code is important!

- In order to best find the answers to my questions, I realized that I have to be very specific in my question. This is especially important when asking google.

- Jeramie G was the driver and I was the navigator. We warp the logic in a function and ACP each seperately.
