    <p>Hey all! I am Luis Sandoval and you can call me Luis. I am originally from Wichita, KS, but just moved
      to Seattle, WA from San Diego, CA about a year ago. I was born on January 25, 1996 at exactly 12:00AM. I am
      married to the love of my life, Alyssa, and together we have two dogs, Nala and Betty. Alyssa is my rock and
      ultimately the fuel that drives me to be great! I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, and lifting weights
      in my free time. Currently I am an aspiring software developer with a love for tech, innovation, and learning.</p>
